### On alarm send SMS {#on-alarm-send-sms}

**Functionality**

If an alarm is created, an SMS is sent.

{{< c8y-admon-req >}}
This smart rule is only available if:
- Your tenant has configured an SMS provider.
- Your user has a READ permission for the permission type "Option management".
{{< /c8y-admon-req >}}

**Parameters**

The rule uses the following parameters:

<table>
<thead>
<colgroup>
       <col style="width: 10%;">
       <col style="width: 20%;">
       <col style="width: 70%;">

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

You can select a single group or a single device (just one, not multiple). To enable it in other assets or devices you must navigate to each context and enable it there. Afterwards you're able to see all target assets or devices in a list with the title "Active for target asset or devices" in the smart rule detail

**Troubleshooting**

* Verify that the alarm was created and not duplicated from somewhere.

* Check if the device is in [maintenance mode](/device-management-application/monitoring-and-controlling-devices/#to-monitor-the-connection-for-multiple-devices). In this case no new alarm will be created because of suppression policy.

* If you have configured an alarm mapping rule (see [Alarm mapping](/standard-tenant/alarm-mapping/)) which changes the alarm severity, the alarm may have different severity than expected.

{{< c8y-admon-important >}}
There is a limit of 160 characters as a total count. If you use variables and after applying the variables the text counts more than 160 characters the SMS will not be sent.
{{< /c8y-admon-important >}}

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

**Description**

When a configured type of alarm is raised, it starts monitoring how long the alarm stays active.

If the alarm is still active after the specified duration, the severity will be increased one level, for example, from MINOR to MAJOR.

If the alarm has reached CRITICAL, it will stop monitoring because there is no further action possible.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
The rule checks once a minute if the configured duration has been exceeded. Therefore it might happen that the alarm severity won't change in the second it exceeds the duration but only after the following check.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

### On geofence create alarm {#on-geofence-create-alarm}

**Functionality**

If a geofence border is crossed, an alarm is created.

The rule can be configured for entering or leaving the geofence, or both. Existing alarms are cleared when the opposite condition is true again, for example, if a tracked car which has left the geofence area is re-entering the geofence area.

**Parameters**

The rule uses the following parameters:

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The unit of the consumption measurement is always per hour (that means, if the measurements are in "kg" the consumption will be in "kg/h").

The rule takes the last two measurements for a specified time, calculates the difference in value and time and then calculates the consumption per hour.

**Example**

The rule is configured to calculate every 20 minutes. The following measurements are coming in:
100 kg at 11:59 and 200 kg at 12:14.
At 12:20 the rule is triggered, taking the last two measurements. It calculates value and time difference. The consumption measurement created at 12:20 will therefore be 400 kg/h.
If no new measurement was created in the last period a measurement with consumption 0 will be created.

### On missing measurements create alarm {#on-missing-measurements-create-alarm}

**Functionality**

If no new measurement data has been received for a specified time, an alarm is created.

**Parameters**

The rule uses the following parameters:

### On measurement threshold create alarm {#on-measurement-threshold-create-alarm}

**Functionality**

If the measurement value enters or leaves the red/yellow range, an alarm is created or respectively cleared.

The severity of alarm is determined as follows:

* If the measurement value moves into the red range, then an alarm of CRITICAL severity is created. If it moves out of the red range, the CRITICAL alarm is cleared.

* If the measurement value moves into the yellow range, then an alarm of MINOR severity is created. If it moves out of the yellow range, the MINOR alarm is cleared.

The rule uses the following parameters from the device object or data point library:

* Data point library red/yellow range: Red range when the system should create CRITICAL alarms and yellow range when the system should create MINOR alarms. Note that the data point should have at least one of red or yellow range configured.

* Object red range: Range when the system should create CRITICAL alarms. These values can be edited in the data explorer for each data point. Note that these are close intervals ([red min: red max]) that contain the lowest accepted value and the highest accepted value, see also examples below.

* Object yellow range: Range when the system should create MINOR alarms. These values can be edited in the data explorer for each data point. Note that these are half-open intervals ([yellow min : yellow max)) that contain the lowest accepted value but not the highest accepted value, see also examples below.

#### Examples {#examples}

**Example 1 - Red range:**

If we set the red range to "[60;90]"

* red min: 60
* red max: 90

and the measured value is between 60 - 90 (including the values 60 and 90) as a result a CRITICAL alarm (red) will be created.

**Example 2 - Yellow range:**

If we set the yellow range to "[30;50)"

* yellow min: 30
* yellow max: 50

and the measured value is between 30 - 49 as a result a MINOR alarm (yellow) will be created. The value 50 is out of the yellow range.

**Example 3 - Red and yellow range:**

As a result of the above behavior, we can set configurations like the following:

* red min: 60
* red max: 90
* yellow min: 30
* yellow max: 60

If the measured value is 60, then as a result a CRITICAL alarm (red) will be created because red includes the value 60.

**Example 4 - Overlap:**

The red range and the yellow range can overlap. A value in this overlap range is treated as being in the yellow range.

If we set the yellow range to "[30;60)" and the red range to "[50;90]":

* red min: 50
* red max: 90
* yellow min: 30
* yellow max: 60

and the measured value is 55, a MINOR alarm (yellow) will be created.

Using these mechanisms, you can configure global threshold ranges in the data point library. These global values can then be overridden for specific objects on a case-by-case basis.

The rule uses the following parameters:

**Description**

For each incoming measurement value, the rule performs the following steps:

* Check if the smart rule has a valid data point. If not, an alarm with MAJOR severity is sent from the rule engine (CEP) informing that the rule has an invalid configuration.

* Check if the rule is activated for the source object.

* Check if the measurement includes data for the fragment and series (configured data point's parameter).

* The data of the red and yellow range is collected from either:

    * The data point library (control parameter).
    * The source object (the measurement). If found, ranges from the source object's data point override are merged.

If no red/yellow ranges are defined in the merged parameters, no alarms are generated.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
Range values defined in the source object have a higher priority than those defined in the data point library. You can also just overwrite a single value (for example yellow range max) by setting it in the source object. The other values will then be taken from the Data Point Library.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

* Incoming value inside the red range: If there is no active alarm of CRITICAL severity of given type for the object, create a CRITICAL alarm, else do nothing.

* Incoming value inside the yellow range: If there is no active alarm of MINOR severity of given type for the object, create a MINOR alarm, else do nothing.

* Measurement outside of yellow and red range: If there is an active alarm of given type for the object, clear the CRITICAL and/or MINOR alarm.

**Troubleshooting**

* Verify that the alarm was created and not duplicated from somewhere.

* Check if the device is in [maintenance mode](/device-management-application/monitoring-and-controlling-devices/#to-monitor-the-connection-for-multiple-devices). In this case no new alarm will be created because of suppression policy.

* If you have configured an alarm mapping rule (see [Alarm mapping](/standard-tenant/alarm-mapping/)) which changes the alarm severity, the alarm may have different severity than expected.

* Check if an alarm was already cleared by the next scheduled measurements with resulting value in a green range.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
* If you clear an alarm, you state that the alarm is resolved. A new alarm is not raised unless the device changes its state and exceeds the thresholds again.

* Under certain circumstances, that means, if the time gap between measurements is quite large, this smart rule may raise a wrong alarm severity. If, for example, the CEP/Apama pod is restarted, the internal state is lost and therefore an alarm is raised again when it should not, resulting in a different alarm severity.

### On measurement explicit threshold create alarm {#on-measurement-explicit-threshold-create-alarm}

**Functionality**

If the measurement value enters or leaves the red range, a CRITICAL alarm is generated or cleared.

The severity of alarm is determined as follows:

* If the measurement value moves into red range, then the severity is CRITICAL.

* If the measurement value moves into GREEN range, no alarm is created.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
This rule is similar to the rule "On measurement threshold create alarm". However, in this rule here the red threshold value is provided explicitly. The threshold rule "On measurement threshold create alarm" extracts the thresholds values from the device or data point library.

### Smart rule variables {#smart-rule-variables}

In certain rule parameters, various trigger fields can be used as variables. When a rule is triggered, the variables are replaced by the actual values of these trigger fields.

You can use this mechanism for example to insert device names or alarm text into various outputs (email, SMS).


**Common fields to be used from all triggers (alarms, measurements, operations, events)**

If using Apama for smart rules (shown by a subscription to Apama-ctrl in <b>Applications</b> > <b>Subscribed Applications</b> in the Administration application),
variables for times can include a time zone and time format to display the time in.
The variable #{time:TZ=America/New_York,FORMAT="HH:mm:ssZ"} for example displays the time using the time zone for New York in the format HH:mm:ssZ.
See also [Supported time zones]({{< link-apama-webhelp >}}/index.html#page/pam-webhelp%2Fco-DevApaAppInEpl_supported_time_zones.html)

    <td>Gets nested structure value.</td>
  </tr>  
  <tr>
    <td>#{source.X.Y} </td>
    <td>The property field information from the source device (ManagedObject) of the trigger. For example:
