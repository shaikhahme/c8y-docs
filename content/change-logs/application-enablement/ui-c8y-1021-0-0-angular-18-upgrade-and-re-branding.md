In a future version, we will update Angular to version 18 and update our base branding. This update brings improvements and new features, but may also introduce breaking changes that could impact your existing implementations. When updating to this new version, please verify your branding, especially the logo position, as it has been modified.

To ensure a smooth transition to Angular 18 and help you to adapt your implementations, we will provide an upgrade documentation when this change happens. This documentation will help you navigate through the changes and update your codebase accordingly.
