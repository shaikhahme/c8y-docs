In earlier versions of the LWM2M agent, only a single agent within the cluster was responsible for hosting the firmware image via an HTTP endpoint. This setup could occasionally lead to 401 responses when devices attempted to download the firmware. With the latest update, all agents in the cluster are synchronized and now host the same set of firmware images, ensuring seamless and reliable firmware downloads.
