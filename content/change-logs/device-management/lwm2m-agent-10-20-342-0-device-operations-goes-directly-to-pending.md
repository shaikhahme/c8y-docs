Previously,
the execution of LWM2M device operations was limited to a specific timeframe following the device's registration with the platform.
However, this timeframe remained static even after the device underwent registration updates,
despite the previous operational window not yet expiring.
This limitation has now been addressed,
ensuring that each LWM2M device registration update extends the device operations timeframe.
