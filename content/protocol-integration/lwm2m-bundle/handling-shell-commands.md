In the **Shell** tab of a device, LWM2M shell commands can be performed. Each command has a different functionality. Find all available placeholders (for example "objectID", "instanceID") and commands with their respective descriptions below:

For example: writeb /3442/0/150 010A0B020F.<br><br>
Writes binary data to a resource on the device from a file uploaded to the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform. The 'binary-file-id' is the object ID that has already been uploaded to the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform.
Adding the prefix 'binary:' lets the agent read the file's data and write it to the device.
For example: writeb /3442/0/150 binary:12345.

<td align="left">coap &lt;requestJson&gt;</td>

<td align="left">Allows a raw CoAP request to be sent to a LWM2M device. The command takes a request JSON string as a single argument. <br />
<br />
Example: <br/>

	coap {

		"uri" : "/3/0",
		"accept" : "application/vnd.oma.lwm2m+json"}

<br />
The CoAP response data is populated into the operation response. Note that {{< product-c8y-iot >}} does not further process CoAP responses. We also recommend you to use raw CoAP requests for device interactions only in exceptional cases. Any interaction with an LWM2M device should be carried out using standard LWM2M operations.

A shell command can also be used to send multiple operations to a LWM2M device at once. To do that, simply enter all instructions with a line break between them. Make sure that the shell command does not carry any leading or trailing white spaces. The LWM2M agent then uses the line break to split a multi-line operation into separate LWM2M shell operations.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

## Shell command lifecycle {#shell-command-lifecycle}
The handling of LWM2M shell commands follows the following lifecycle:

1. When a shell command is created the corresponding operation status is set to PENDING. This means that the corresponding CoAP request has not yet been sent to the device.
2. The {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform processes the shell command. It sends a corresponding CoAP request to the device and updates the operation status to EXECUTING.
3. The next status update depends on the response of the device.
    - *Successful request*: In case the device signals a successful operation using a 2.XX CoAP response code, the operation result is updated and the operation status is turned to SUCCESSFUL.
    - *Failed requests*: If the CoAP request fails with a 4.XX or 5.XX error on the device, the operation is marked as FAILED. The operation result contains a possible response of the device.
    - *Not-responding*: When sending a LWM2M command to a device the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform is not precisely aware if the device can be reached using a UDP datagram. If the request times out {{< product-c8y-iot >}} assumes that there is no connectivity. It puts the operation back to PENDING. A redelivery of the operation is triggered as soon as the device sends a registration update or a new LWM2M registration request.
4. To view the history of all operations, click the **Control** tab.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
If enabled, the agent will periodically look for starved operations of a tenant and fail them automatically.
Starved operations are device operations which have had a status of EXECUTING and have not been updated for a long time.
Platform administrators can configure how long such operations stay alive. This is described in the *LWM2M agent installation & operations guide*, see also [Additional resources > Installation and operations documentation](/additional-resources/more-documentation/#installation-and-operations-documentation). Contact your Operations team for further details.
