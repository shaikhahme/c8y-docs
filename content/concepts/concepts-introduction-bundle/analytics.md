{{< product-c8y-iot >}} offers powerful analytics capabilities that enable businesses to extract valuable insights from their data as well as to operationalize derived insights using real-time rules.Â 

For this, {{< product-c8y-iot >}} comes with [real-time data streaming and processing](/concepts/realtime/) capabilities, allowing businesses to process and take immediate action based on incoming data. Rules can be created within the [Streaming Analytics application](/streaming-analytics/introduction-analytics/#home), and the predefined [smart rules](/cockpit/smart-rules/) make data analytics accessible also to non-technical users. Real-time rules do allow for both triggering external workflows (such as the creation of a service ticket) as well as sending operations back to the equipment to, for example, optimize machine operations based on analytical insights.

[{{< product-c8y-iot >}} DataHub](/datahub/datahub-overview/) makes it easy for data analysts and data scientists to derive insights from the equipment data by allowing for high-performant analytical queries. The support for SQL via standard ODBC/JDBC interfaces allow for a seamless integration with any data analytics tool and workflow.

{{< product-c8y-iot >}} integrates seamlessly with popular analytics tools and AI frameworks, allowing businesses to apply sophisticated algorithms to their IoT data.
